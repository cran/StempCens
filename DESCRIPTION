Description: It estimates the parameters of spatio-temporal models with censored or missing data using the SAEM algorithm (Delyon et al., 1999). This algorithm is a stochastic approximation of the widely used EM algorithm and is particularly valuable for models in which the E-step lacks a closed-form expression. It also provides a function to compute the observed information matrix using the method developed by Louis (1982). To assess the performance of the fitted model, case-deletion diagnostics are provided.
